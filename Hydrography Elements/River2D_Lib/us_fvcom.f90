!    The Unstructured Grid Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model                   !
!                                                                              !
!    The USG-FVCOM (publically called FVCOM) was developed by Drs. Changsheng  !
!  Chen and Hedong Liu at the Marine Ecosystem Dynamics Modeling Laboratory    !
!  at the School of Marine Science and Technology (SMAST), University of       !
!  Massachusetts-Dartmouth (UMASSD) and Dr. Robert C. Beardsley at the         !
!  Department of Physical Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution   !
!  (WHOI). This code was rewritten in Fortran 90/2K, modularized, rendered     ! 
!  somewhat understandable, and parallelized by Geoff Cowles at SMAST/UMASSD.  !
!                                                                              !
!    The Development was initially supported by the Georgia Sea Grant College  !
!  Program for the study of the complex dynamic system in Georgia estuaries.   !
!  The code improvement has been supported by Dr. Chen's research grants       !
!  received from NSF and NOAA Coastal Ocean research grants and SMAST-NASA     !
!  fishery research grants. The University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth          !
!                                                                              !
!    FVCOM is a three dimensional,time dependent,primitive equations,          !
!  coastal ocean circulation model. The model computes the momentum,           !
!  continuity, temperature, salinity, and density equations and is closed      !
!  physically and mathematically using the Mellor and Yamada level-2.5         !
!  turbulent closure submodel. The irregular bottom slope is represented       !
!  using a sigma-coordinate transformation, and the horizontal grids           !
!  comprise unstructured triangular cells. The finite-volume method (FVM)      !
!  used in this model combines the advantages of the finite-element            !
!  method (FEM) for geometric flexibility and the finite-difference            !
!  method (FDM) for simple discrete computation. Current, temperature,         !
!  and salinity in the model are computed in the integral form of the          !
!  equations, which provides a better representation of the conservation       !
!  laws for mass, momentum, and heat in the coastal region with complex        !
!  geometry.                                                                   !
!                                                                              !
!    All users should read this agreement carefully.  A user, who receives any !  
!  version of the source code of FVCOM, must accept all the terms and          !
!  conditions of this agreement and also agree that this agreement is like any !
!  written negotiated agreement signed by you. You may be required to have     !
!  another written agreement directly with Dr. Changsheng Chen at SMAST/UMASS-D!
!  or Dr. Brian Rothschild, Director of the SMAST/UMASS-D that supplements     !
!  all or portions of this agreement. Dr. Changsheng Chen, leader of the       !

!  required for all new users.  Users should realize that this model software  !
!  is a research product without any warranty. Users must take full            !
!  responsibility for any mistakes that might be caused by any inappropriate   !
!  modification of the source code.  Modification is not encouraged for users  !
!  who do not have a deep understanding of the finite-volume numerical methods !
!  used in FVCOM. Contributions made to correcting and modifying the programs  !
!  will be credited, but will not affect copyrights. No duplicate              !
!  configurations of FVCOM are allowed in the same geographical region,        !
!  particularly in the regions where FVCOM has been already been applied.      !
!  Users who want to use FVCOM in a region that the SMAST/UMASS Marine         !
!  Ecosystem Dynamics Modeling (MEDM) group (led by Dr. Chen) is working on    !
!  must request permission from Dr. Chen. No competition is allowed in the     !
!  same region using FVCOM, especially with Dr. Chens group. FVCOM has been   !
!  validated for many standard model test cases.  Users are welcome to do any  !
!  further model validation experiments. These experiments shall be carried    !
!  out in collaboration with the SMAST/UMASSD model development team. To avoid !
!  or reduce deriving any incorrect conclusions due to an inappropriate use of !
!  FVCOM, users are required to contact the scientific leaders of the FVCOM    !
!  development team (Dr. Chen at SMAST/UMASS-D and Dr. Beardsley at WHOI)      !
!  before any formal publications are prepared for model validation.           !
!                                                                              !
!    For public use, all users should name this model as "FVCOM". In any       !
!  publications with the use of FVCOM, acknowledgement must be included. The   !
!  rationale behind this FVCOM distribution policy is straightforward.  New    !
!  researchers and educators who want to use FVCOM and agree to the above      !
!  requirements get free access to the latest version of FVCOM and the         !
!  collective wisdom and experience of the FVCOM development team and existing !
!  users. Problems arising in new FVCOM applications, both related to          !
!  conceptual as well as numerical and coding issues, can be shared with the   !
!  development team and other users who can work together on physics and code  !
!  improvements that over time will lead to a better FVCOM.                    !
!                                                                              !
!    FVCOM has been developed to date with state and federal funding with the  !
!  idea that FVCOM will become a community model as new users start to use   !
!  the model and its scientific usefulness and numerical accuracy and          !
!  efficiency continue to improve.  The FVCOM distribution policy is designed  !
!  to encourage this transition while maintaining a central core group         !
!  responsible for overall FVCOM development direction, implementing official!
!  code improvements, and maintaining well tested and documented updated code  !
!  versions.                                                                   !

!  1) Tidal amplitudes and phases at open boundaries (initial designs          !
!         include 6 tidal consituents, more can be added as needed);           !
!  2) Wind Stress [3 ways: a) uniform wind speed and direction, b)             !
!         spatially distributed wind velocity field, and c)the MM5 model-out   !
!         wind fields]                                                         !

!         All the surface net heat flux and short-wave radiation are needed    !

!  Initial fields of temperature and salinity needed to be specified           !
!  by using either climatological field, real-time observed field or           !
!  idealized functions. The model has included Gregorian time for the          !
